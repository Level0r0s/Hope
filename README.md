# Hope
Hope is an open source Object Pascal development environment based on DWScript.

# Requirements
In order to compiler, debug and build HOPE, a recent Delphi version is required. While the code is generally written in a rather portable way, at least XE2 is required so far.
In the future it should also compile under FPC.

# Build
To build the project first clone the repository with

    git clone git://github.com/Walibeiro/Hope.git    

All required submodules will be downloaded as well (this may take a while)

After that you should be able to open and build the project file Source\Hope.dproj

# Contribution
Feel free to fork this repository and alter what ever you want. However, in order to get pull requests accepted, the changes must comply to a few rules:

* The code should not use the latest edge language feature
* The code must be clean and commented
* The code must be formated according to the Object Pascal Style Guide (see http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/10280)
* The code should be written with portability in mind (Lazarus / Linux, OSX)

# Downloads

So far no prebuilt binaries are available. However, as soon as the project will reach an alpha state, prebuilt binaries will be made available.

# License
This project is licensed under GPL. It is mainly because I think development tools should be open to everyone.
